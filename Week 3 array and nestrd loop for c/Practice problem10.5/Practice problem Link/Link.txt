problem no 1:
You are given an positive integer N (Here N means number of terms) . Now print the following sequence as shown
below.

For N=10 , the sequence should be
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

Sample Input 1: 										Sample Output 1:
10												 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
Sample Input 2: 										Sample Output 2:
1 													0
Sample Input 3: 										Sample Output 3:
2 													0 1

Hints – Basically It’s a Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the next term is the sum of
the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 followed by 1.
>> Implement it using array.


problem no 2:
Write a C program to take one positive integer N, the size of an array as input. Then take a positive integer array
of size N as input and sort the array in ascending order. It is guaranteed that the input array will contain distinct
integers.
Note – It is possible to sort an array without any sorting algorithm. Hence for this problem you can’t use any
sorting algorithm.
Sample Input 1: 											Sample Output 1:
5 													1 3 5 6 17
6 1 5 3 17
Sample Input 2: 											Sample Output 2:
7 													1 2 5 7 9 10 15
5 2 15 7 9 1 10

Hints – Check the 31st October conceptual session.




problem no 3: 
Write a C program to take one positive integer N, the size of an array as input. Then take a positive integer array
of size N as input and tell if the sum of odd values is even or not.
If the sum of odd values is even print YES otherwise NO.

Sample Input 1: 										Sample Output 1:
5 													YES
5 2 7 4 6
Sample Input 2: 										Sample Output 2:
5 													NO
3 17 8 10 3


Problem no 4:
Write a C program to take one positive integer N, the size of an array as input. Then take a positive integer array
of size N . And next line will contain k . Now find the k-th smallest element from the array.

Sample Input: 										Sample Output:
6													 6
6 25 1 4 9 17
3

Explanation – For the above test case k=3 means you need to find the 3rd smallest element from the array




Problem no 5:
Write a C program to take one positive integer N, the size of an array as input. Then take a positive integer array
of size N . Now count the number of prime numbers from this array and print them.
In the sample output the first line will contain count of prime numbers and second line will contain the prime
numbers.

Sample Input 1: 										Sample Output 1:
5 													2
2 10 4 21 97 2 97
Sample Input 2: 										Sample Output 2:
6 													3
5 12 16 19 23 9 5 19 23

Hints – Nested loop



Problem no 6:
Write a C program to take a positive integer N and print the pattern as shown below
For N=4, the pattern should be
Sample Input: 										Sample Output:(pattern)
6
