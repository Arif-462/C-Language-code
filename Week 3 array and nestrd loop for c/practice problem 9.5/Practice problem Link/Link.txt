Problem no 01:
Write a C program to take one positive integer N, the size of an array as input. Then take an integer array of size
N as input and show output in reverse order.

Sample Input: 									Sample Output:
5 											5 10 3 20 1
1 											20 3 10 5


Problem no 02:
You will be given an positive integer N and after that an integer array of size N. Then you will be given Q which
refers to queries. For each query you will be given i and v where i refers to the index and v to value. You need to
add the value to that index. After all of the queries print the values

Sample Input:					 				Sample Output:
5 											11 2 8 4 10
1 2 3 4 5
3
0 10
2 5
4 5


Problem no 03:
Write a C program to take one positive integer N, the size of an array as input. Then take an integer array of size
N as input and tell if the array contains only one unique value or not. Print “YES” or “NO”.

Sample Input 1: 									Sample Output 1:
5												 NO
2 4 2 2 4
Sample Input 2: Sample Output 2:
5 												YES
4 4 4 4 4 
 

Problem no 04:
Write a C program to take one positive integer N, the size of an array as input. Then take an integer array of size
N as input. You need to print the values and for every value, you need to print other values than that. See the
samples for more clarification.Hints: Use nested loop

Sample Input: 									Sample Output:
5 												1 - 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5 											2 - 1 3 4 5
 												3 - 1 2 4 5
 												4 - 1 2 3 5
 												5 - 1 2 3 4 

Problem no 05:
Write a C program to take one positive integer N, the size of an array of unique values as input. Then take an
integer array of size N as input. After that take another integer target. You need to tell if you can make target by
adding any two different values from that array.
Hint: Use nested loop

Sample Input: 									Sample Output:
5 												YES
2 4 3 6 8
7

Sample Input: 									Sample Output:
5 												NO
2 4 3 1 8
8 


Problem no 05:
Write a C program to take a non-negative integer N and print the pattern as shown below
For N=5, the pattern should be

*
**
***
****
*****
Sample Input: 									Sample Output:
4 												*
 												**
 												***
 												****
